# Claude - Project Instructions

## ALWAYS Use uv for Python

**IMPORTANT**: This project uses `uv` for all Python operations.

- ✅ Run scripts: `uv run python script.py` or `uv run src/train.py`
- ✅ Add dependencies: `uv add package-name`
- ❌ NEVER use `python`, `python3`, or `pip` directly

## Plan and verify inside plans folder

When planning or writing markdown files, create files under plans folder (when make sense to do so).
If need to verify, create a script in the plans folder to verify. If it doesn't make sense to keep it - remove it after verification.
